           <p>Alex was a real pleasure to work with. I had a tricky situation with leaking downspout that needed to be repositioned. Alex responded to my Thumbtack request quickly, met with me the netx day, provided a proposal later that day and worked through a series of follow up questions. He even found a company to scope the downspout drains for me. The work itself was of excellent quality (he came and did the work himself).</p>
